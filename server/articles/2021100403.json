    "text":"Roberta Lynn Williams (n√©e Heuer; born February 16, 1953)[1][2] is an American video game designer and writer, who co-founded Sierra On-Line with her husband, game developer Ken Williams. In 1980 her first game Mystery House became a modest commercial success, and is credited as the first graphic adventure game. She is also known for creating and maintaining the King's Quest series, as well as designing the full motion video game Phantasmagoria in 1995.\n\nSierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996, leading to layoffs and management changes. Roberta took a brief sabbatical and returned to the company in a game design role, but grew increasingly frustrated with CUC's creative and business decisions. After the release of King's Quest: Mask of Eternity in 1998, she left the game industry in 1999 and focused her retirement on travelling and writing historical fiction. In 2021 she released her historical novel, Farewell to Tara. Soon after, she announced her return to game development, intending to create a 3D remake of the classic adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure.\n\nSeveral publications have named Roberta Williams as one of the best or most influential creators in the video game industry, for co-founding Sierra, pioneering the graphic adventure game genre, and creating the King's Quest series. Several publications have called her the \"Queen of adventure games\". She has received the Industry Icon Award from The Game Awards, and the Pioneer Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards.\n"
