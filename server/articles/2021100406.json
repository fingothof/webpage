Shadow Knights was the first game created for Softdisk, who paid $5000 for it as part of id Software's contractual obligation to them.[2] Shadow Knights was also marketed by Softdisk as part of \"The Lost Game Collection of ID Software\".[3]\n\nThe prospering land of Naipusan falls under siege by warriors from the North led by the evil shogun Sashika. For many years Sashika grew in power and began learning dark magic. Some said that Sashika was possessed by the demon Kuskuro. In the wake of the never-ending reign of terror, a ninja born in the east whose arrival foretold by sages comes to remove Sashika from his seat of power and rule Naipusan fairly.[4]\n"
